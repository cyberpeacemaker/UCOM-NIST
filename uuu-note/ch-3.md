# üîπ What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is like a phone number for your device on a network. It‚Äôs a 32-bit number (in IPv4), usually shown as four numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).

## üîπ Network ID and Host ID

An IP address is divided into **two parts**:

| Part           | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network ID** | Identifies **which network** the IP address belongs to  |
| **Host ID**    | Identifies a **specific device** (host) on that network |

Network ID, Network Address, Network Segment
Host ID, Host Address

* **Routers** use the **Network ID** to send data to the correct network.
* Once it gets to the network, the **Host ID** is used to find the exact device.

## Subnet Mask

The subnet mask decides how much of the IP address is network vs. host.

Example masks:

* `255.0.0.0` ‚Üí Class A (1st octet = network, rest = host)
* `255.255.0.0` ‚Üí Class B (2 octets = network)
* `255.255.255.0` ‚Üí Class C (3 octets = network)


## üîπ What is an IP Class?

In the early days of the internet, IP addresses were divided into **five classes (A to E)** to support networks of various sizes:

| Class | First Octet | Subnet Mask   | Hosts per Network | Purpose            |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| A     | 1‚Äì126       | 255.0.0.0     | ~16 million       | Large networks     |
| B     | 128‚Äì191     | 255.255.0.0   | ~65,000           | Medium networks    |
| C     | 192‚Äì223     | 255.255.255.0 | 254               | Small networks     |
| D     | 224‚Äì239     | N/A           | Multicast         | Special use        |
| E     | 240‚Äì255     | N/A           | Experimental      | Not for public use |

> ‚ùó Note: `127.x.x.x` is reserved for loopback (e.g., `127.0.0.1` = localhost).
> ‚ùó Note: `0.x.x.x` is reserved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Classful IPs Are Outdated

Modern networks mostly use **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** instead of class-based IPs. CIDR allows **more flexible subnetting** without being restricted by classes.
