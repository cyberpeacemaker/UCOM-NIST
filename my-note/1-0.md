# 🌐 **Introduction to OSI 7 Layers**

>**Bonus**
**ISO** stands for the **International Organization for Standardization**.
**A common misconception:**
Although the full name is **International Organization for Standardization**, the abbreviation is **ISO**, not **IOS**. Why?
**ISO** comes from the Greek word **"isos"** meaning **equal**.
The founders chose "ISO" as a universal short form, regardless of the language (English: International Organization for Standardization, French: Organisation internationale de normalisation, etc.).
So, no matter the language, the abbreviation stays **ISO**.


The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a **standard framework** that divides network communication into **7 distinct layers**. Each layer represents a specific step in the process of transmitting data over a network, from one device to another.

These layers help in **standardizing communication**, so different hardware and software systems can work together smoothly.

Here are the **7 layers of the OSI Model**, listed from **top (Layer 7)** to **bottom (Layer 1)**:

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Presentation Layer**
3. **Session Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Network Layer**
6. **Data Link Layer**
7. **Physical Layer**

## Theoretical v.s. Practical

* The *OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a **theoretical** framework with 7 layers. It was created to help *tandardize how different networking technologies work and interoperate.
* **Technologies don't have to literally implement "layer 1, 2, 3..."** but their functions can be mapped to those layers.

So it's not a protocol or a rulebook — it's more like a **blueprint or reference guide**.


### ✅ Do All Network Technologies Follow OSI?

* Not strictly. But **almost all networking technologies can be described using OSI terms**.
* Technologies like **Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, Zigbee, etc.** all implement some functions that correspond to OSI layers.


### 🔍 Examples: How Technologies Map to OSI


| Tech                        | Layer 1 (Physical)          | Layer 2 (Data Link)            | Layer 3 (Network)        | Layer 4–7 (Transport to Application)    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Ethernet**                | Copper/fiber cables         | MAC addressing (802.3)         | IP (via TCP/IP)          | Web, email, etc.                        |
| **Wi-Fi**                   | Radio signals (2.4/5/6 GHz) | MAC + frames (802.11)          | IP                       | TCP/UDP apps like browsers, etc.        |
| **Bluetooth**               | Short-range radio           | L2CAP, HCI (Bluetooth stack)   | Optional (not always IP) | Often app-specific protocols            |
| **Cellular** (e.g., 4G, 5G) | RF spectrum, basebands      | MAC, RLC, PDCP (LTE/5G layers) | IP or GTP tunneling      | All IP-based apps (browsing, streaming) |
| **Zigbee / IoT**            | Low-power RF                | IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer        | Sometimes IPv6 (6LoWPAN) | MQTT, CoAP, etc.                        |


### ⚠️ Important Distinction

* OSI model is **used for understanding and design**, not enforced.
* **Real-world stacks** don’t follow OSI exactly — for example:

  * TCP/IP merges OSI layers 5–7 into one “Application” layer.
  * Some protocols *skip* layers (Bluetooth may not use IP at all).


## Error Checking

### 🔹 1. **Data Link Layer Error Checking (Layer 2)**

* **Scope**: Works between two directly connected nodes (hop-by-hop).
* **Purpose**: Ensures the frame was received **correctly over the physical link**, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
* **Common methods**:

  * CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
  * Parity bits
* **Limitations**:

  * Only ensures **local delivery** (i.e. between adjacent routers, or a host and a switch).
  * Doesn't handle end-to-end reliability.


### 🔹 2. **Transport Layer Error Checking (Layer 4)**

* **Scope**: Works **end-to-end**, from sender to final receiver (e.g., between your computer and a web server).
* **Purpose**: Ensures that the entire message arrives **intact**, **in order**, and **without corruption** — even if it passed through many hops.
* **Examples**:

  * TCP uses a **checksum** to verify the integrity of the segment.
  * Handles retransmissions, sequencing, flow control, etc.
* **Important for reliability** over an **unreliable network (IP)**.

✅ **Reason for both**:
Errors can happen **at any layer** — due to electrical noise (Layer 2) or packet drops/corruption during routing (Layer 3). The **Transport Layer ensures complete, reliable communication**, regardless of what happens at lower levels.

### Analogy:

Imagine sending a **package across multiple delivery hubs**:

* Each **hub checks if the box is intact before forwarding it** (Data Link Layer).
* But only the **sender and final recipient check if the entire shipment was received correctly and completely** (Transport Layer).

### 🔄 Summary

| Layer          | Who uses it?                 | Where is error check applied? | What happens on error?         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Data Link (L2) | Each hop (routers, switches) | On each link                  | Frame is discarded             |
| Transport (L4) | Only at sender & receiver    | End-to-end                    | Segment is retransmitted (TCP) |

# OSI vs. TCP/IP
## 🧱 **OSI vs. TCP/IP: Overview**
*OSI model* is a **theoretical framework** with 7 layers for learning and standardization. *TCP/IP model* is a **practical model** used on the Internet with 4 layers.**They describe the same networking process**, but at different levels of detail. You can **map OSI layers to TCP/IP layers**, though some OSI layers are merged in TCP/IP.


| Feature          | **OSI Model**                      | **TCP/IP Model**                    |

| Number of layers | 7                                  | 4                                   |
| Concept          | Theoretical, for understanding     | Practical, used in real networking  |
| Protocol-based?  | No                                 | Yes (built around the TCP/IP stack) |


## 🧩 **Mapping OSI 7 Layers to TCP/IP 4 Layers**

Here’s how they **relate** to each other:

| **OSI Layer**   | **TCP/IP Layer**          | **Function**                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 7. Application  |                           |                                             |
| 6. Presentation | **Application**           | User interface, data formatting, encryption |
| 5. Session      |                           |                                             |
| 4. Transport    | **Transport**             | Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)            |
| 3. Network      | **Internet**              | Routing, addressing (IP)                    |
| 2. Data Link    |                           |                                             |
| 1. Physical     | **Network Access / Link** | Physical transmission, MAC addressing       |

> ✅ **Note**: The **TCP/IP model combines some OSI layers**, especially:

* OSI Layers 5–7 → into TCP/IP **Application Layer**
* OSI Layers 1–2 → into TCP/IP **Network Access Layer**

# 🔌 **What is Ethernet?**

*Ethernet* is a widely used **networking technology** that connects devices in a **local area network (LAN)**. It allows computers, printers, routers, and other devices to **communicate with each other using cables** (typically twisted-pair or fiber optic).

Ethernet defines both:

* **Wiring standards** (how devices are physically connected), and
* **Communication rules** (how data is formatted and transmitted).

Originally developed in the 1970s, Ethernet has evolved to support **faster speeds**, such as **Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)**, **Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps)**, and even **10 Gbps and higher**.

TODO:
### CSMA/CD

### 📦 Ethernet in the OSI Model

Ethernet mainly operates at:

* **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** – Physical connections like cables and signals.
* **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** – MAC addressing and frame delivery between devices on the same network.

# 📡 **Wi-Fi v.s Ethernet**


* Both **Ethernet** and **Wi-Fi** are ways to **connect your device to a network**.
* The **difference** is in **how they transmit data**:

| Feature    | Ethernet                        | Wi-Fi                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Connection | **Wired (uses cables)**             | Wireless (uses radio signals)            |
| Stability  | More stable, less interference  | Can have signal drops                    |
| Speed      | Generally faster and consistent | Can vary based on distance/interference  |
| Range      | Limited by cable length         | Works within a certain range from router |


##  **OSI Model (7 Layers)**

| Layer Number | Layer Name   | Ethernet Role                                                                    | Wi-Fi Role                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7            | Application  | Same for both — protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc.                                   | Same for both                                                                                                   |
| 6            | Presentation | Same for both                                                                    | Same for both                                                                                                   |

| 2            | **Data Link**    | Ethernet defines MAC addressing and frame formats for wired communication        | Wi-Fi uses IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless frames and MAC addressing (different frame formats and protocols) |
| 1            | **Physical**     | Physical cables and electrical signals (e.g., twisted pair cables, fiber optics) | Wireless radio waves (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz bands) and modulation techniques                                    |

##  **TCP/IP Model**

TCP/IP has 4 layers, roughly mapped to OSI:

| TCP/IP Layer   | OSI Equivalent Layers | Ethernet vs Wi-Fi Difference                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application    | 7,6,5                 | Same protocols, no difference                                                                         |
| Transport      | 4                     | Same (TCP/UDP)                                                                                        |
| Internet       | 3                     | Same (IP addressing and routing)                                                                      |
| Network Access | 2 + 1                 | Ethernet: Wired frame formats and electrical signals; Wi-Fi: Wireless frame formats and radio signals |

## Summary of **Key Differences in Rules** (mostly Layer 1 & 2):

| Aspect          | Ethernet                                                         | Wi-Fi                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical Medium** | Copper/fiber cables (wired)                                      | Radio waves (wireless)                                                                                                  |
| **Frame Format**    | IEEE 802.3 frames                                                | IEEE 802.11 frames                                                                                                      |
| MAC Addressing  | Same concept (unique device ID)                                  | Same concept but with additional wireless-specific fields (e.g., management frames, beacon frames)                      |
| Error Handling  | Uses CRC for error detection                                     | Uses more complex retransmission and acknowledgment due to wireless interference and fading                             |
| Access Method   | CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) | CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) — because collisions can’t be detected well wirelessly |
| Speed & Range   | Typically faster and more stable                                 | Variable speed, depends on signal strength, interference                                                                |
| Security        | Depends on network; often physical security                      | Uses encryption standards like WPA2, WPA3 for wireless security                                                         |

**So in a nutshell:**

* **Above Layer 2 (Data Link), Ethernet and Wi-Fi behave almost identically** — they carry the same IP packets, use the same TCP/UDP, and support the same apps.
* **At Layers 1 and 2**, they have different physical media and protocols adapted to wired vs wireless environments.

## 🌐 **Role in Connecting to the Internet**

Whether you're using **Ethernet** or **Wi-Fi**, both are just **methods to connect to your local network (LAN)** — usually through a **router**.

From there:

* The **router** sends your data to the **modem** (sometimes combined into one device).
* The **modem connects to your ISP (Internet Service Provider)**.
* The ISP gives you access to the **Internet**.

So, the **Internet** sits "beyond" your local network, while **Wi-Fi** and **Ethernet** are just two different **ways to access that local network**.

**How They All Work Together (Example)**

Imagine you're watching YouTube:

1. **Your laptop uses Wi-Fi** (or Ethernet) to connect to your **home router**.
2. The router forwards the request to the **modem**, which connects to the **Internet via your ISP**.
3. The video data comes from YouTube servers, through the Internet, back to your **modem**, then **router**, and finally to your device via **Wi-Fi or Ethernet**.

### ✅ Summary

| Term         | What It Is                 | Role in Communication                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Ethernet** | Wired LAN connection       | Sends data locally via cables        |
| **Wi-Fi**    | Wireless LAN connection    | Sends data locally via radio signals |
| **Internet** | Global network of networks | Sends/receives data worldwide        |

**Key idea**:
**Wi-Fi and Ethernet are different ways to connect to the same network**, which then connects you to the **Internet**.
