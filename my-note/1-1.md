# cmd 指令

## `tracert` 

`tracert` (short for **trace route**) is a network diagnostic command used in Windows to track the path that data packets take from your computer to a destination (like a website or server).

It shows each **hop** (router or gateway) the packet passes through and the **time** it takes to reach each one. This helps identify network delays or routing problems.

**Usage Example:**

```
tracert www.google.com
```

## `netstat` 

`netstat` (short for **network statistics**) is a command-line tool used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and more. It's useful for diagnosing network issues and monitoring active connections.


### Commonly Used Parameters in `netstat` (Windows & Linux)

| Parameter      | Description                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`           | Displays **all** connections and listening ports.                               |
| `-n`           | Shows addresses and port numbers in **numeric** form (no DNS lookup).           |
| `-o` (Windows) | Displays the **process ID (PID)** for each                         |


**Example**:

```
netstat -ano
```

Displays all connections with IP addresses, port numbers, and associated PIDs.


### `route PRINT`

The `route PRINT` command is used in **Windows** to display the current **IP routing table** of the system.

This table determines how packets are forwarded between your computer and other networks (e.g., local networks, the internet).


### Output Sections:

When you run:

```
route PRINT
```
You'll typically see three main sections:

1. **Interface List**
   Shows all network interfaces (like Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and their corresponding index numbers.

2. **IPv4 Route Table**
   Lists all IPv4 routes, including:

   * **Network Destination**: The target network or host.
   * **Netmask**: Specifies the subnet.
   * **Gateway**: Where the packet is forwarded.
   * **Interface**: Local IP address used for the route.
   * **Metric**: Cost of the route (lower is preferred).

3. **IPv6 Route Table**
   Similar to the IPv4 table but for IPv6 networks.



### ✅ Common Parameters:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-4`          | Displays **IPv4** routes only.                                                            |
| `-6`          | Displays **IPv6** routes only.                                                            |
| `<interface>` | Show routes associated with a **specific interface** (by interface index).                |
| `-f`          | **Clears the DNS cache** before displaying the route table (helps resolve names freshly). |

# Router

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a **network interface card (NIC)**. Since a router has multiple network interfaces (like one for the **WAN/internet** side and one or more for the **LAN/local** side), it typically has at least **two MAC addresses**:

## 1. **WAN MAC address**

* This is the MAC address of the router's **external interface** (the one that connects to your ISP).
* This is the MAC your **internet service provider (ISP)** sees and sometimes binds your internet connection to.


## 2. **LAN MAC address**

* This is the MAC address of the router's **internal interface**, used to communicate with your local devices.
* Devices on your home network (like phones, laptops) see this as the **default gateway MAC address**.

## 3. **Wi-Fi Interfaces**

* If the router supports **Wi-Fi**, each wireless interface (e.g., 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands) may also have its **own MAC address**.

---

# Routing Table
### ❓ Why is the **routing table** shown in the **terminal (your PC)**? Isn't it only in the **router**?

**Short Answer:**
Your **computer** (PC, server, etc.) also has its own **local routing table** — not just routers!

> **Every device with a network interface** (like a computer, phone, printer, etc.) has a routing table to decide **where to send outgoing packets**.



### 🔍 Explanation:

* The **router's routing table** decides how to **forward packets between networks** (e.g., from your home to the internet).
* Your **computer's routing table** decides:

  * Which **network interface** to use (e.g., Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet).
  * Whether a destination IP is **on the local network** or needs to be sent to a **default gateway** (the router).


### 🖥️ Example: Your PC's Role

When you open a browser and type `www.example.com`, your PC:

1. Resolves the domain to an IP.
2. Looks at its **local routing table** (via `route print`) to decide:

   * "Is this IP on my local subnet?"
   * If **yes**, it sends it directly.
   * If **no**, it sends it to the **default gateway** (router).
3. The **router** then uses its own routing table to forward the packet.


### 📌 Summary:

| Routing Table Location      | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Your PC** (`route print`) | Decides where **your PC** sends outgoing packets.                        |
| **Router**                  | Forwards packets **between different networks** (e.g., LAN to Internet). |

# 🔹 "Broadcast" in TCP/IP?

In TCP/IP networks, **broadcast** refers to sending a packet **from one device to all devices** on the same **local network (subnet)**.

It's primarily used at the **network (IP) and data link (Ethernet)** layers and is most commonly associated with **UDP**, **not TCP** (we’ll explain why below).

## 🔸 Types of Broadcasts

### 1. **Limited Broadcast**

* **IP Address:** `255.255.255.255`
* **Meaning:** Sent to **all hosts** on the local network.
* **Used When:** The sender doesn’t know the network's subnet (e.g., during boot).
* **Not routable**: It never leaves the local subnet.

### 2. **Directed Broadcast**

* **IP Address:** `network.broadcast`

  * For example, in `192.168.1.0/24`, the directed broadcast address is `192.168.1.255`.
* **Meaning:** Sent to all devices on a **specific remote subnet**.
* Often **blocked by routers** for security reasons.

### 3. **Ethernet Broadcast**

* **MAC Address:** `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`
* All devices on the local Ethernet network will process it.

## 🔸 Protocols That Use Broadcast

* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** – To find a MAC address from an IP.
* **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** – For IP assignment.
* **NetBIOS** – Name resolution in older Windows networks.

## 🔸 Why TCP Doesn't Use Broadcast

* TCP is **connection-oriented** and **reliable**, requiring handshakes and acknowledgments.
* Broadcast is **one-to-many**, and TCP can’t manage the required state or ACKs for multiple receivers.
* **UDP**, being **connectionless**, is better suited for broadcasting.


## ✅ Summary

| Type               | IP Address           | Layer     | Scope             |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Limited Broadcast  | `255.255.255.255`    | IP        | Local subnet only |
| Directed Broadcast | e.g. `192.168.1.255` | IP        | Specified subnet  |
| Ethernet Broadcast | `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`  | Data Link | Local LAN         |

## **Short Introduction to IEEE 802:**

**IEEE 802** is a family of standards developed by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**. It defines protocols for **local area networks (LAN)** and **metropolitan area networks (MAN)**. The most well-known among these is **IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)** and **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)**.

* Started in **1980** (hence the name "802").
* Covers technologies like **Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,** etc.
* Focuses primarily on the **lower layers** of networking.

# IEEE 802 

The **IEEE 802 standards** correspond mainly to the **bottom two layers** of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model:

| **OSI Layer**    | **IEEE 802 Relevance**                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 7. Application   | Not covered by IEEE 802                             |
| 6. Presentation  | Not covered by IEEE 802                             |
| 5. Session       | Not covered by IEEE 802                             |
| 4. Transport     | Not covered by IEEE 802                             |
| 3. Network       | Not directly (handled by IP, not IEEE 802)          |
| 2. **Data Link** | **Covered by IEEE 802** (MAC & LLC sublayers)       |
| 1. **Physical**  | **Covered by IEEE 802** (electrical, cables, radio) |

## More specifically:

* *IEEE 802.1*: **Defines overall architecture, bridging, and management (spanning tree, VLANs, etc.)**.
* *IEEE 802.2*: Logical Link Control (*LLC*) – part of Layer 2.
* *IEEE 802.3*: Ethernet – defines both Layer 1 (physical) and part of Layer 2 (MAC).
* *IEEE 802.11*: Wi-Fi – also defines both Layer 1 and Layer 2.

## **In Summary:**

* *IEEE 802* provides standards for networking at the **Physical** and **Data Link** layers of the OSI model.
* It **implements the infrastructure over which higher-layer protocols (like IP, TCP, HTTP) operate.**

Let me know if you want a diagram or table to visualize this!


## 🔁 Relationship Between **Topology** and **IEEE 802 Standards**

### 🧩 1. **Topology** = *Physical or Logical Layout*

* Defines **how devices are connected** (physically or logically).
* Examples: Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, etc.

### 📘 2. *IEEE 802 Standards* = *Communication Rules/Protocols*

* Define **how data is transmitted and controlled** over a network.
* Includes things like addressing, access control, and media type.

## 🔗 How They Are Related:

While **topology** describes **structure**, the **IEEE 802 standards** define **behavior** over that structure. Some IEEE standards are designed with specific topologies or transmission methods in mind.

Here are key examples:

| **IEEE 802 Standard**  | **Protocol/Tech**    | **Typical Topology**       | **Description**                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **802.3**              | Ethernet             | Star or Bus (historically) | Most common LAN standard; uses switches (star) today, but started with bus. |
| **802.11**             | Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN) | Star or Mesh               | Devices connect wirelessly to an access point (AP), forming a logical star. |
| **802.4** *(obsolete)* | Token Bus            | Bus                        | Rare; used for industrial networks (now mostly replaced).                   |
| **802.5** *(legacy)*   | Token Ring           | Ring (logical)             | IBM’s Token Ring; used a physical star but operated as a logical ring.      |
| **802.15**             | Bluetooth, PANs      | Star, Mesh, Peer-to-Peer   | Personal Area Networks; supports flexible topologies.                       |
| **802.16**             | WiMAX                | Point-to-Multipoint        | Used for metropolitan area networks (MANs); mostly wireless.                |


### 🧠 Key Insight:

* **IEEE 802 standards don’t dictate topology**, but they often assume or work best with certain ones.
* For example, **Ethernet (802.3)** works great with a **star topology**, while **Token Ring (802.5)** is built around a **logical ring** structure.

### ✅ Summary:

| Concept      | Role                      | Example                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Topology** | How devices are connected | Star, Ring, Bus                  |
| **IEEE 802** | How devices communicate   | 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.11 (Wi-Fi) |

They’re **complementary** — topology provides the layout, IEEE 802 defines the **rules of communication** over that layout.


Exactly — you've hit the key point. ✅

---

## ✅ In Theory:

Yes, **in theory**, you can **mix and match** network **topologies** with **IEEE 802 standards** in many combinations.

For example:

* Use a **mesh topology** with Wi-Fi (802.11) – possible ✔
* Use **Ethernet (802.3)** over a **ring topology** – *theoretically* maybe, but **practically rare** ✖


## 🚫 In Reality:

**Not all combinations are practical or supported.**
Certain **IEEE standards are tightly coupled with specific topologies** or media access methods.

Let’s go deeper with your example:


### 🔁 Token Ring vs Ethernet:

| Feature                | **Token Ring** (IEEE 802.5)     | **Ethernet** (IEEE 802.3)                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topology               | **Logical Ring**, Physical Star | **Star** (today), Bus (original)                                 |
| Access Method          | Token passing                   | CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) |
| Cable Types            | STP, UTP                        | UTP, Fiber                                                       |
| Max Speed (historical) | 16 Mbps                         | 10 Mbps → 100 Gbps+                                              |
| Status                 | **Obsolete**                    | **Dominant standard today**                                      |


> **You can't use Token Ring (802.5) with Ethernet (802.3)**
> because they use **different access methods** and **incompatible data link layer protocols**.




## ✅ Real-World Pairings (Examples):

| **IEEE Standard**         | **Typical Topology** | **Access Method**             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 802.3 (Ethernet)          | Star                 | CSMA/CD or full-duplex        |
| 802.11 (Wi-Fi)            | Star, Mesh           | CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance) |
| 802.15 (Bluetooth/Zigbee) | Mesh, Star           | Token or polling              |
| 802.16 (WiMAX)            | Point-to-multipoint  | Scheduled access              |

# OSI, TCIP/IP, IEEE 802

## ✅ **1. OSI Model – Reference Only**

The **OSI 7-layer model** is a **theoretical framework** used to understand and describe how data moves through a network. It helps standardize terminology and concepts, but it's **not directly implemented** in real-world networks.

---

## ✅ **2. TCP/IP Model – Practical Internet Stack**

The **TCP/IP model** (also called the **Internet Protocol Suite**) is what we **actually use on the Internet**. It has **4 layers**, which roughly map to the OSI model:

| **TCP/IP Layer**   | **Equivalent OSI Layers** | **Function**                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Application**    | OSI Layers 5–7            | Apps, HTTP, DNS, etc.                    |
| **Transport**      | OSI Layer 4               | TCP, UDP                                 |
| **Internet**       | OSI Layer 3               | IP, ICMP, routing                        |
| **Network Access** | OSI Layers 1–2            | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, drivers, physical media |

---

## ✅ **3. IEEE 802 Standards – Real Implementation of Layers 1 & 2**

In the **TCP/IP "Network Access" layer**, we rely on **IEEE 802 standards** to handle the actual transmission of data over **hardware (wires, radio waves, etc.).**

* **IEEE 802.3** = Ethernet (wired LAN)
* **IEEE 802.11** = Wi-Fi (wireless LAN)
* **IEEE 802.1** = Bridging, VLANs, and network management
* **IEEE 802.2** = Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer

So in practice:

> ✅ We **use TCP/IP** for communication protocols (logical layers)
> ✅ We **use IEEE 802** standards for how devices physically connect and share the media (data link + physical layer)

## 🔄 Summary Diagram:

```
Real-World Internet Stack:
--------------------------------------------------------
 Application Layer         -->  HTTP, DNS, FTP
 Transport Layer           -->  TCP, UDP
 Internet Layer            -->  IP, ICMP
 Network Access Layer      -->  Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
                             -->  OSI Layers 1 & 2

### 🔹 **EIA/TIA vs IEEE 802 – What's the Difference?**

| Aspect                | **EIA/TIA**                      | **IEEE 802**                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**             | Physical cabling & connectors    | Data communication protocols             |
| **Example**           | TIA/EIA-568 (structured cabling) | IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet communication)      |
| **Layer (OSI Model)** | Layer 1 (Physical)               | Layer 1 (Physical) & Layer 2 (Data Link) |
| **Who defines it**    | TIA (Telecom industry)           | IEEE (Engineering/technical body)        |


### 🔗 **How Are They Related?**

They are **complementary** standards:

* **TIA/EIA** defines **how to wire and install the cables** (e.g., Cat6, RJ-45 pinouts).
* **IEEE 802** defines **how the data travels** over those cables (e.g., Ethernet frame structure, MAC addresses).

> **Example**:
> When you install a Cat6 Ethernet cable (as per TIA/EIA-568), you can run **IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)** over it.
> So, the cable is TIA/EIA-compliant, and the communication protocol is IEEE 802-compliant.


### ✅ Summary

* *TIA/EIA* = **Physical cabling standards**
* *IEEE 802* = Communication protocols over the network
* They **work together** to ensure end-to-end network compatibility and performance.

# VLAN

*VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)* is a network technology that **allows you to divide a physical network into multiple logical networks**. Devices on the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are in different locations. VLANs help improve network performance, enhance security, and simplify network management by isolating traffic and reducing broadcast domains. They are commonly used in large organizations to separate departments like HR, Finance, and IT.

# Collision

為什麼 Switch 之間不會發生碰撞？

1. **全雙工傳輸（Full Duplex）**
   現代的交換機與交換機之間通常使用全雙工連接，可以同時進行接收與發送資料，**沒有碰撞的機會**。

2. **獨立的碰撞域**
   與集線器（Hub）不同，交換機每個埠都有自己獨立的碰撞域，所以即使多台設備連到同一台交換機，也不會造成碰撞。

# 🔧 **Technical Aspects of LAN vs WAN**

| **Aspect**         | **LAN** (Local Area Network)                                 | **WAN** (Wide Area Network)                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware used**  | Routers, switches, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi access points      | **Routers, modems, satellite links, fiber optics, leased lines**                          |
| **Technology**     | Ethernet (wired), Wi-Fi (wireless)                           | **MPLS, ATM, Frame Relay, leased lines, VPN, satellite**                                  |
| Speed          | Typically 100 Mbps to 10+ Gbps                           | Typically 1 Mbps to 1 Gbps, sometimes higher with fiber                           |
| **Protocols**      | TCP/IP, Ethernet, ARP, ICMP                                  | TCP/IP, MPLS, BGP, OSPF, SD-WAN                                                       |
| **Error checking** | Fewer errors due to short distances and cleaner environments | More error checking and correction needed due to long distances and more interference |
| **Latency**        | Very low (a few milliseconds)                                | Higher (can be tens or hundreds of ms)                                                |
| **Security**       | Easier to secure (physical control over network)             | Harder to secure; often uses encryption and VPNs                              |
| **IP addressing**  | Private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x)                     | Public and private IPs; must route over the Internet or private backbone              |
| **Control**        | Full control over devices and traffic                        | Shared control with ISPs or third-party providers                                     |

### 🧠 Example:

* In a **LAN**, data goes from your laptop → router → printer. All inside your home. Fast and simple.
* In a **WAN**, data might go from your laptop → local router → ISP → internet backbone → another country → server. Much more complex!

### 🛠️ Advanced Tech in WANs:

* **SD-WAN (Software Defined WAN):** Makes WANs smarter and more flexible using software.
* **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching):** Routes data efficiently over a private WAN.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates a secure “tunnel” over a public WAN like the Internet.
