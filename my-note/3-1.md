# Word Byte
The number of **bytes in one word** depends on the **computer architecture**:

* **16-bit architecture**: 1 word = **2 bytes**
* **32-bit architecture**: 1 word = **4 bytes**
* **64-bit architecture**: 1 word = **8 bytes**

So, **"word" size is architecture-dependent**. Let me know which system or context you're referring to if you need a specific answer.
