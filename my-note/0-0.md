`certsrv` is the core Windows service for **Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)** â€” Microsoft's implementation of a **Certificate Authority (CA)**. It is responsible for issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates within a Windows environment.

### Key Points about `certsrv`:

* **Service Name**: `CertSvc` (shown as **Active Directory Certificate Services** in the Services console).
* **Executable Path**: Typically runs under `C:\Windows\System32\certsrv.exe`.
* **Primary Role**: Issues and manages X.509 digital certificates for secure communication (e.g., SSL/TLS, smart card logins, email encryption, etc.).
* **Web Interface**: When installed, AD CS can expose a web enrollment interface at `http://<servername>/certsrv` for users and computers to request or download certificates.
* **Backed by CertLog**: Certificate logs and transaction logs are stored in `C:\Windows\System32\CertLog`.

### Typical Usage Scenarios:

* Deploying **internal PKI** for secure communications.
* **Smart card logon** and authentication.
* **Encrypting File System (EFS)** and **S/MIME** email encryption.
* Issuing certificates for **VPN**, **Wi-Fi**, and **web servers** (IIS/HTTPS).
