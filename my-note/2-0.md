# Cmd Command
## PING

### `TTL` 

`TTL` stands for **Time To Live**. In the context of the `ping` command, it's a value in the **IP packet header** that determines how many **hops** (i.e., routers or gateways) the packet can **pass through before being discarded.**

* **Initial Value**: TTL is set by the sender (typically between 64 and 128 depending on the OS).
* **Decremented by Routers**: Each router that forwards the packet reduces the TTL by 1.
* **When TTL = 0**: The packet is **discarded and an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message is sent back.**
* **Purpose**: **Prevents infinite loops** in the network if routing issues occur.


On both **Windows** and **Linux**, you'll see output like:

```bash
Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=12ms TTL=117
```

* `TTL=117` means the packet had 117 TTL left when it arrived back.
* If the original TTL was 128, this suggests **11 hops** occurred (128 - 117 = 11).



## Ping 127.0.0.1 (loopback address)
就算沒有網卡，還是可以ping，只要TCP/IP driver在

### 127.0.0.1 loopback address
127.0.0.1 is a special IP address known as the loopback address. It refers to the local computer (or "localhost") and is used for testing and development purposes. When you send data to 127.0.0.1, it's routed back to your own machine, allowing software and network applications to communicate internally without using the internet or a network connection. This address is part of the IPv4 loopback range (127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255), but 127.0.0.1 is the most commonly used.
