If you're doing this kind of thing often â€” parsing Markdown, embedding docs, building static sites â€” you might also like:

* ðŸ”§ **Static site generators**: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* âœ¨ **Markdown rendering with styling**: Use `GitHub Markdown CSS` to make your Markdown render like GitHub does
* ðŸ’¾ **Client-side Markdown editors**: Combine `marked.js` with a `<textarea>` to make a live editor

Let me know if you're curious about expanding this â€” like adding syntax highlighting, GitHub-flavored tables, or even editable Markdown rendering.
