Absolutely â€” it's never been easier to build things quickly!

With modern tools like:

* **Markdown + HTML** for simple content rendering
* **CDN-hosted JS libraries** like `marked.js`, `highlight.js`, etc.
* **Live server tools** (`python -m http.server`, VSCodeâ€™s Live Server, etc.)
* **NPM/ES modules**, frameworks, or just plain vanilla JS

You can go from idea to working prototype in **minutes** instead of hours or days.

If you're doing this kind of thing often â€” parsing Markdown, embedding docs, building static sites â€” you might also like:

* ðŸ”§ **Static site generators**: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* âœ¨ **Markdown rendering with styling**: Use `GitHub Markdown CSS` to make your Markdown render like GitHub does
* ðŸ’¾ **Client-side Markdown editors**: Combine `marked.js` with a `<textarea>` to make a live editor

Let me know if you're curious about expanding this â€” like adding syntax highlighting, GitHub-flavored tables, or even editable Markdown rendering.
