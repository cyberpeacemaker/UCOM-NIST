**CIDR** stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**, and it is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets more efficiently than the old "classful" IP addressing system.

### ðŸ”¹ What is CIDR?

CIDR is a way of representing IP addresses and their associated network masks **without relying on traditional IP address classes (A, B, C)**. Instead, it uses **variable-length subnet masking (VLSM)**, which allows more flexible division of IP address space.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Format of CIDR Notation

CIDR notation uses the format:

```
<IP address>/<prefix length>
```

**Examples:**

* `192.168.0.0/24`
* `10.0.0.0/8`
* `172.16.5.128/25`

Here:

* The **IP address** identifies the network.
* The **prefix length** (`/24`, `/8`, etc.) tells you how many bits are used for the network portion of the address.

### ðŸ”¹ CIDR vs. Classful IP Addressing

| Feature               | Classful Addressing | CIDR Addressing                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Fixed address classes | Yes (A, B, C)       | No (Flexible prefixes)             |
| Subnet mask           | Implied by class    | Explicit with prefix (e.g., `/24`) |
| IP space usage        | Inefficient         | Efficient, reduces waste           |

### ðŸ”¹ CIDR and IP: The Relationship

1. **CIDR is applied to IP addresses**â€”both IPv4 and IPv6.
2. It defines how much of an IP address is for the **network** and how much is for **hosts**.
3. It enables efficient **IP address allocation** by ISPs and more scalable **routing** on the internet (route aggregation).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example

Suppose you have:

```
192.168.1.0/24
```

* IP range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
* Usable hosts: 254 (excluding network & broadcast)
* Netmask: 255.255.255.0

If you instead use:

```
192.168.1.0/26
```

* IP range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.63
* Usable hosts: 62
* Netmask: 255.255.255.192

So, CIDR allows more **granular control** over IP ranges.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why CIDR Matters

* Reduces **routing table size** (via route summarization)
* Supports **IP conservation** (important with IPv4 exhaustion)
* Enables **flexible subnetting** and network design
