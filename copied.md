You're absolutely on the right track — and you're thinking in exactly the right way. Let's break it down and refine the idea a bit to make everything clear.

## ✅ You're Right About This:

Yes — **at each hop along the route**, a packet **doesn't go all the way up the stack**. For example:

* Routers typically process data **only up to Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.
* They **don’t look at the Transport Layer (Layer 4)** or higher, unless it's a firewall or something doing deep packet inspection.
* But **each link between routers** involves **Layer 1 (Physical)** and **Layer 2 (Data Link)**.

---

## 📦 So what happens at each hop?

Imagine sending a message from Host A to Host B through several routers:

```
Host A ── R1 ── R2 ── R3 ── Host B
```

At each **link (e.g., Host A → R1)**:

1. **Layer 2 (Data Link)**:

   * Adds its own **frame header and trailer** (e.g., Ethernet frame).
   * Does **error checking** using CRC.
   * If an error is detected → **frame is discarded**.

2. **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**:

   * The IP **packet inside the frame** is extracted and forwarded.
   * The router updates the frame for the next hop.

3. **Layer 4+**:

   * The router **doesn't touch or check** the transport layer (like TCP) or higher layers.
   * These are only processed at **end devices** (the sender and the receiver).

---

## 🧠 So why do we still need Transport Layer error checking?

Because:

* Errors can **slip through** even after CRC checks — especially over **wireless**, or due to **software bugs**, **memory corruption**, etc.
* Some routers or middleboxes might not behave perfectly.
* **No guarantee** that every single hop will detect or correct all problems.
* And most importantly: **Data Link checks are local; they don't ensure the message reaches the final destination correctly**.

Only the **Transport Layer (like TCP)** does **end-to-end checking**.

## 📘 Bonus: You're also right to say "Protocol Data Unit" (PDU)

That’s the proper name!

* **Layer 2 PDU** = Frame
* **Layer 3 PDU** = Packet
* **Layer 4 PDU** = Segment (TCP) or Datagram (UDP)

So when you said **“package (or should I say PDU?)”** — yes, that’s the correct technical term. Nicely done.

Let me know if you want to walk through an example of a packet moving through the layers — or how TCP handles retransmission in real-world scenarios. You're asking great questions.
